# Grouper uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from grouper.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the grouper.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the grouper.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to the grouper.properties

#if groups like the wheel group should be auto-created for convenience (note: check config needs to be on)
configuration.autocreate.system.groups = true

# A wheel group allows you to enable non-GrouperSystem subjects to act
# like a root user when interacting with the registry.
groups.wheel.use                      = true

# Set to the name of the group you want to treat as the wheel group.
# The members of this group will be treated as root-like users.
groups.wheel.group                    = etc:sysadmingroup

# Used to allow Include Exclude groups
grouperIncludeExclude.use = true
grouperIncludeExclude.requireGroups.use = true
